Introduction to Github
Kyle-not-kylie here, I am sick of my job and fascinated by the world of programming and all its applications. I am completely new to this and in my 30's...... shock horror.....  but, as of right now I am taking my first steps towards, what I hope will be a new and exciting career in software development. Wish me luck!!!
